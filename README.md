##### Onome Akpogheneta & Eleanor Alvarez 

*A Humanitarian Crisis is a situation or event where there is a significant threat to the health, safety, and well-being of a largenumber of people, often resulting from factors such as natural disasters, armed conflict, 
or socio-political instability. It can lead to widespread displacement, loss of life, and critical shortages of basic necessities such as food, water, shelter, and medical care*

- With pro-active & anticipatory approaches morbidity & mortality could be prevented, but humanitarian sector is mostly focused on responding to crises
- The INFORM Risk Index is a global, open-source risk assessment for humanitarian crises and disasters. It can support decisions about prevention, preparedness and response.
- Using INFORM data products, this project explores whether machine learning from historical crisis risk data could help predict & predict the likelihood of future humanitarian crises  

The Goals of this Project are to: 
1. Explore INFORM risk index data to predict humanitarian crises
2. Explore INFORM risk index data to predict severity of humanitarian crises
3. Predict & forecast how INFORM data is likely to change over time
